REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

- RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make queries), and delete data.
Thus, REST uses HTTP for all four CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.

- GET is the most common HTTP operation, used for reading data on the web; GET a PAGE

- POST is the request sent by a browser when you submit a form.
  In Rails applications, POST requests are typically used for creating things (although HTTP also allows POST to perform updates).

- PATCH and DELETE, are designed for updating and destroying things on the remote server.
